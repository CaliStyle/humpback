#Contributers

## Style Guide
Humpback uses a jshint file for standardized javascript for the front and backend.  

##Development Process
Developers work in their own brances, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Humpback maintainers simply merges it.

If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the patch submitter will be asked to start a discussion with the devs and community.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't match the project's coding conventions (see doc/coding.txt) or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Tags are created regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Humpback.
