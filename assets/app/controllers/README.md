##Controllers
Controllers are the client side equivlent of sails.js backend controllers.

##Grunt
Controllers are included into the app via a grunt task. see `tasks/register/humpback.js`

To create a new Controller use the command 
```sh
$ sails generate humpback-controller <CONTROLLER_NAME>
````

This will create a Sails API Controller as well as a Humpback controller.
