#Humpback Road Map
##Where to from here?

Humpback is quickly evolving and so is the web around us.  We want to build a platform that will last
and that includes making some future proofing changes to Humpback.

When Humpback was started, angular was getting pretty old and angular 2 was way way to new, but many of
us agree with the concepts of angular 2, which is where we think humpback will move to.  

###Typescript
We want to completely convert the humpback platform over to Typescript.

###Angular 2
We want rebuild all the Humpback modules to tightly integrate with the angular 2 methodology to make 
development even quicker and resuable.

###Barnacles
Humpback currently uses installable hooks called Barnacles.  We want to standardize a way to create and 
use these.  Possiblly even make a market place for them. 

###Pipelines
It's not a secret that devs have a lot of choices when it comes to their pipeline.  Wether that's AWS, Gcloud, Heroku, etc.
We would love to make prekitted pipelines that make deploying humpback a breeze on these platforms and allow for 
continuous integration and deployment. Heck, why not add some Hubot stuff in there?

##The Choice is up to you!
Even when I started Humpback I was never under the illusion that I was the best at this.  I knew it was ambitious
and I would have to really count on the OS community to feel the same pains as me and want to work together to 
solve them.  So the call is up to all of us now.
